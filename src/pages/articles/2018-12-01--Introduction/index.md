Hey there 👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾! Not sure how you found me but welcome to my world hahah.

Soooo I decided that I'm going to start a personal tech blog! I'm always working on random tech projects, so I figured it would be nice to gather my thoughts and random ideas in once place.

By no means do I expect to come up with anything genius 😂😂, so if you're looking for some specific inspriation you better leave now hahah. 

But if you're looking for someone who's relatable, down to try new things, kinda OCD with code structure, loves solving problems, and genuinely enjoys CODE, thennnn I guess you can stay :)
